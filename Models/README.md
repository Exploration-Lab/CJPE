# Case Decision Prediction

ILDC documents are long and have specialized vocabulary compared to typical corpora used for training text classification models and language models. For predictiong the case decisions we experimented with various types of models:
- **Classical Models**
-  **Sequential Models**
- **CNN**
- **Transformers**

Please refer to each folder for more details on each model. Also the ipynb notebooks are annotated with relevant comments which will allow you to go through the notebook without much problem. Also the `Explanation` directory contains the code for the Occlusion algorithm which was used to get explanations for our model's output.
