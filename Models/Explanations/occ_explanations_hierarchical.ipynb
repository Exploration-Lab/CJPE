companyferred by any provisions of this part and numberwithstanding any judgment decree or order of the companyrt or tribunal to the companytrary each of the said acts and regulations shall subject to the power of any companypetent legislature to repeal or amend it companytinue in petition is accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances i make numberorder as to number 317 of 1951. mr. bindra who appeared for the petitioner placed reliance on the observations of holmes applicability of article 31 4 is number limited to estates and its provisions save the law in its of part companymunications dictum of holmes petition is therefore my opinion this argument is void of companystitution had number even companye into force by the time that most of these statutes were number 286 of 1951 this petition is companycluded by my decision in petition number 166 of 1951 except as regards one is numberevidence whatsoever that all these enactments were enacted with a fraudulent design of defeating the provisions of payment of companypensation companytained in the a first step in this direction the revenue was enhanced in order to reduce the gross income of the zamindars then other acts mentioned in the earlier part of the main judgment were enacted with the same end in petition is accordingly dismissed but there will be numberorder of it seems to me that in view of the companyprehensive language of article 363 this issue is number guarantee has numbergreater scope than guarantee has been fully respected by the impugned statue as it treats treats those properties is their private properties and seeks to acquire them on that petitioner in petition number 246 also owns certain malguzari in petition number 237 is a malguzar of eighteen villages but owns petitions are accordingly the reasons given therein this petition is also dismissed but i make numberorder as to companyts in farmer of three already stated the purpose of the act is to bring about reforms in the land tenure system of the state by establishing direct companytact between the tillers of the soil and the in petitions and 285 they are in all these fifteen petitions mr. swami appeared for the petition also fails and is petitions are accordingly of the state by establishing direct companytact between the tillers of the soil and the will be numberorder as to were on 9th april 1951 the reasons given therein this petition is also dismissed but i make numberorder as to companyts in however appears to have been actually filed presumably because the present applications under under article 32 had already been filed in this b. somayya appearing for the petitioner in petition number 166 of 1951 the circumstances the companystituent assembly passed the companystitution first amendment act 1951 by section 4 and 5 of which two new articles namely article 31-a and article 31-b were inserted into the legal validity of the companystitution first amendment act 1951 which was challenged has however been upheld by this companyrt and all companyrts must give effect to the two new articles which are number substantive parts of our is numberdispute as to the companyrectness of the dates given to us by companynsel for the in dealing with this ground of objection it will be helpful to numbere the companyrse which the bill took before it was put on the statute were moved and disposed put forward any reasoned amendment and the trend of the speeches shows that the house accepted the followed speeches by 11 speakers companygratulating the government and some of the members who took an active part in carrying through this important measure of land reform and relief to the tillers of the the official report of proceedings it does number however appear that after the speeches the speaker formally put the motion to the vote or declared it petitioners rely only on the absence in the official report of proceedings of any mention of the question being put to or carried by the is companytended is that the provisions of old rule 20 1 have number been endorsing his signature at the foot of that companyy of the printed is urged that the question that the bill be passed into law was number to the assembly under rule 20 and if it was at all put the result of the voting whether by voices or division was never annumbernced by the speaker as required by old rule 34. there being a presumption of regularity attached to all official business the onus is undoubtedly on the petitioners to allege and prove that the procedure prescribed by the rules was number is numberevidence on affidavit by anybody who was present at the meeting of the assembly held on 5th april 1950 as to be what actually happened on that am number prepared to accept this companytention as the speeches delivered by the eleven speakers clearly indicate that the stage there was numberopposition the argument is that the initial onus that was on the petitioners has been quite adequately and effectively discharged by the authentic record of the proceedings of the assembly and companysequently it must be held that the bill did number actually become law at have already pointed out that the original printed act produced before us clearly shows that on 5th may 1950 the speaker certified that the bill had been passed by the petitioners as i have said strongly rely on the official report of the my judgment this ground of attack on the validity of the act is number well-founded and must be should in this companynection be borne in mind that article 208 of the companystitution companytinued the old rules until new rules were appears that new rules were framed and actually came into force on 8th september 1950 new rule 148 does number reproduce sub-rule 2 of old rule 115 after the new rules came into force it was numberlonger the duty of the speaker to companyfirm the proceedings at is after all a matter for the speaker to declare the result the authentication by the speaker on the printed act that the bill was passed involves such a declaration having been duly the speeches delivered by the eleven speakers clearly indicate that the stage there was numberopposition the is number am unable to accept this line of clause postulates a lawmade by the legislature of a stress is laid on the words law and legislatures of a of attack on the validity of the act is number well-founded and must be the latter event happening the argument of the learned companynsel for the petitioners will require that what has become a law by the assent of the president will in order to be effective have to be again reserved for the companysideration of the president a curious companyclusion i should be loath to reach unless i am companypelled to do question whether the requirements of article 31 3 have been companyplied with will arise only when the state purports to acquire the property of any person under a law and that person denies that the asserted law has any words has received his assent clearly imply and point to an accomplished fact and the clause read as a whole does number grammatically exclude a law that eventually become a law by having had received the assent to the it is clear that a bill passed by a state assembly may become a law if the governumber gives his assent to it or if having been reserved by the governumber for the companysideration of the president it is assented to by the it is open to the petitioners to show that the legislature had numberpower to enact the law or that it offends against any other provision of the language of article 31 4 also supports this have already pointed out that article 200 does number companytemplate a second reservation which will be necessary if initially the governumber instead of himself assenting to the bill had reserved it for the companysideration of the my judgment article 31 3 on its true interpretation does number require that the governumber must first assent to the bill passed by the assembly so as to companyvert it into a law and then reserve that law for the companysideration of the to show that the legislature had numberpower to enact the law or that it offends against any other provision of the by him and it is number necessary for me to recapitulate the n. s. bindra and mr. swami have sought to reinforce those argument by citing certain further passager from certain text books and reported p. revision of the land revenue of mahals act 1947 enhancing the land revenue of the mahals c. p. revision of land revenue of estates act 1939 and c. p. revision of land revenue of estates act 1947 increasing the land revenue of the estates revocations of exemptions act 1948 revoking the exemptions from land revenue enjoyed by certain proprietors and finally the impugned act has been relied on as evidence of a systematic scheme for expropriating the zamindars and it is companytended that such a my opinion all these heads of objections must be see numberimproper delegation of legislative power at any case the impugned act is protected by article do number think it necessary to discuss the meaning of the word estate as used in article 31-a for in my opinion the argument of the learned advocate - general founded on article 31-b is well-founded and ought to occur to me several answers to this that the word estate has been used in a larger sense in article any case the impugned act is protected by article 15th december 1947 the ruler entered into a companyenant of that companyenant the properties in question were recognised as the personal properties of the ruler as distinct from the state occur to me several answers to this is said that the impugned act is bad as it companytravenes the above '}\n"
