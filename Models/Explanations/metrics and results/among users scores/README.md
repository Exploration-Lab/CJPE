# User vs. User scores

**Note**: You will need the anno_explanations_scores.xlsx (in the parent directory of the current directory) file to create the averaged out results.

The **uservsusermetric.ipynb** file creates the file **resultsamongusers.xlsx**, that contains 8 sheets with each sheet corresponding to the eight metrics we defined in the paper that is ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, Jaccard Similarity, BLEU, METEOR, Overlap-min, Overlap-max.
