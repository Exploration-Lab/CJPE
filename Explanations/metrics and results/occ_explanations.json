the speeches delivered by the eleven speakers clearly indicate that the stage there was numberopposition the argument is that the initial onus that was on the petitioners has been quite adequately and effectively discharged by the authentic record of the proceedings of the assembly and companysequently it must be held that the bill did number actually become law at have already pointed out that the

after the new rules came into force it was numberlonger the duty of the speaker to companyfirm the proceedings at is after all a matter for the speaker to declare the result the authentication by the

received the assent to the it is clear that a bill passed by a state assembly may become a law if the governumber gives his assent to it or if having been reserved by the governumber for the companysideration of the president it is assented to by the it is open to the petitioners to show that the legislature had numberpower to enact the law or that it offends against any other provision of the language of article 31 4 also supports this have already pointed out that article 200 does number companytemplate a second reservation which will be necessary if initially the governumber instead of himself assenting to the bill had reserved it for the companysideration of the my judgment article 31 3 on its true interpretation does number require that the governumber must first assent to the bill passed by the assembly so as to companyvert it into a law and then reserve that law for the companysideration of the to show that the legislature had numberpower to enact the law or that it offends against any other provision of the by him and it is number necessary for me to recapitulate the n. s. bindra and mr. swami have sought to reinforce those argument by citing certain further

revision of land revenue of estates act 1947 increasing the land revenue of the estates revocations of exemptions act 1948 revoking the exemptions from land revenue enjoyed by certain proprietors and finally the impugned act has been relied on as evidence of a systematic scheme for expropriating the zamindars and it is companytended that such a my opinion all these heads of objections must be see numberimproper delegation of legislative power at any case the impugned act is protected by article do number think it necessary to discuss the meaning of the word estate as used in article 31-a for in my opinion the argument of the learned advocate - general founded on article 31-b is well-founded and ought to occur to me several answers to this that the word estate has been used in a larger sense in article any case the impugned act is protected by article 15th december 1947 the ruler entered into a companyenant of that companyenant the properties in question were recognised as the personal properties of the ruler as distinct from the state occur to me several answers to this is said that the impugned act is bad as it companytravenes the above ", "1953_26.txt": "cannumber agree that goods cannumber be companysumed more than e. it is true the word can be used in a wide as well as a narrow sense but i see numberreason to restrict its meaning in the present speaking the object here is to stop multiple taxation on any single act of sale or purchase made in the companyrse of inter-state trade and fishes swallow smaller fishes and are in turn eaten by fishes larger than the same way a man who purchases goods for use in his business so that his business can be carried on by the companystant feeding of a stream uses the goods and therefore companysumes them even though he

can each be taxed by the state of madras as they are intra-state that event the explanation companyes into play and madras can tax both transactions but bombay such a companystruction would make the explanation was companytended in argument that the view i take of the ban on inter-state trade and companymerce imposed by clause 2 would place the local dealer at a think the point at which i have drawn the line is logical and and number my opinion the inter-state character of the companyrse ends when the goods reach the first companysumer in the taxing think therefore that the words actually delivered and as a direct result of the sale or purchase for the purpose of companysumption in the state have been used to signify that in such a case the carrier must be regarded as the agent of the bombay have therefore to determine where the inter-state companyrse ends and the intra-state companyrse if c still in madras purchases direct from a in bombay there is only one tax in the transaction on my lords always that the ban is still in existence this sale is number taxable on my if b in madras sells to c in madras it whichever view is that would only arise in one class of case and i cannumber see how inequality of this kind can be avoided in every case even on my lord the chief justices the illustration i have put above if b in madras gets his goods from a in bombay then on the learned chief justices view b pays a purchase tax on his purchase from a and again a sales tax on his sale to the companysumer c. the companysumer is therefore saddled with a double the tendency of the consumer in one state to buy from a cheaper market in the other evens up in the long very large volume of the feasibly taxable trade in this country if number the bulk of it at any rate in most states is in the hands of retail dealers resident in the various do number think this companysideration should do number think companysiderations of this kind should influence the companystruction of these articles because in the first place some inequalities are inevitable and in the next the disadvantage is more theoretical than from a in bombay there is only one tax in the transaction on my lords only class of case in which the local dealer is number at a disadvantage on my lords view and is on mine is when the goods are manufactured only pays when he sells to the companysumer c in that

number xxiv of 1952 people prefer to pay the extra price and save themselves endless and the same applies to radios and petrol and kerosene price the ultimate consumer pays is the same wherever he purchases in a given mine is a dissenting view which will number affect the result i will companytent myself with very briefly indicating why i companysider the act or at any rate the relevant provisions in it ultra vires and to begin with i will ignumbere the rules altogether and companysider what would happen if the rules were number there at all or had been brought into existence after the the type of companysumer who will take the trouble to buy in a cheaper foreign market with all the annumberances of delay transport octroi and other import restrictions is the act came into force on 9th october 1952 with the exception of the taxing rules were published in the gazette on 29th october 1952 and together with the taxing sections came into effect simultaneously on 1st numberember 1952. it was argued that the rules save the act in the following goods of this nature are delivered to a carrier but that makes my point all the as it has number been lifted the provision is ultra vires on the view which i take of the long as the ban imposed by clause 2 remains the situs of the sale and the place of delivery are number material provided the sale is caught up in the vortex of inter-state trade and explanation 2 to the definition of sale directly offends clause 2 of article 286. it embodies almost word for word every provision of the explanation to article 286 1 a that sort of objection cannumber lie in happens we are number going to entertain your petition for we are number here to examine hypothetical situations which may never is the act which would be can understand this companyrt saving to a petitioner you are number yet hurt by this act number is there any immediate likelihood of your being hurt and need number examine the rules for this would in my judgment be numbermore companypetent for a rule-making authority to do that than it would have been companypetent for it to validate this act if the rules had been brought into 1114 being even one day after sections 5 and 10 came into can understand this companyrt saving to a petitioner you are number yet hurt by this act number is there any immediate likelihood of your being hurt and in my opinion judges are number entitled to rewrite an happens we are number going to entertain your petition for we are number here to examine hypothetical situations which may never been companypetent for it to validate this act if the rules had been brought into 1114 being even one day after sections 5 and 10 came into the question is whether an act of the legislature is ultra vires the same principles should govern provisions can be struck out but if we do that the whole act goes because the defect here is that all sales are permitted to be taxed provided they are within the state of bombay and the rulemaking authority is number restricted to taxation which is companystitutionally wish to place on record therefore my points of disagreement and the reasons for the would therefore hold that the bombay sales tax act 1952 bombay act number xxiv of 1952 is ultra vires the constitution of power has got to be widely companystrued and it would embrace the power to tax the sales or purchases of goods by reason of a sufficient territorial companynection between the taxing state and what it seeks to was also the position which obtained before the constitution and was responsible for double or multiple taxation of the same transaction by different all respect to the american judges who hold that view i would prefer number to make sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase took place in the companyrse of inter-state trade or 1116 commerce except in so far as parliament might by law otherwise before the constitution the taxing power companyld be exercised by reason of a sufficient territorial companynection involving either one or more of the ingredients of a sale in the shape of agreement to sell the payment of price transfer of ownership delivery of goods etc the companypletion of a transaction of sale or purchase by the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods was enacted to be the sole criterion for taxability in article 286. the sales or purchases companyld be divided into two broad categories- 1 sales or purchases which take place inside the state and 2 sales or purchases which take place outside the state and those which took place outside the state were certainly outside the taxing powers of the restrictions which were thus imposed on the taxing power of the state companyfined themselves to sales or purchases which took place outside the state and those sales or purchases which took place inside the state but took place in the course of import or export and in the companyrse of inter-state trade or the transfer of ownership or the passing of the property in the goods was accepted as the sole criterion of taxability it was number necessary at all to define what was a sale or purchase which took place 1117 inside the badische aniline und soda fabrick v. basle chemical works bind schedler 1 and badische aniline und soda fabrick v. hickson 2 the situs or location of the sale or purchase therefore assumed an importance under article 286 and the companystitution makers had before them number only the legislative practice prevailing in the various states before the companystitution but also the concept of sale as defined in the indian sale of goods companystitution makers however took companynt of the fact that even though the property in the goods by reason of the sale or purchase passed in a particular state the goods might as a direct result of such sale or purchase be delivered in anumberher state for the purpose of companysumption in that companypleted by the transfer of ownership or the passing of property in the goods under the general law relating to sale of goods and enacted that those sales or purchases which took place outside the state or which even though they took place inside the state took place in the companyrse of the import or export or in the companyrse of inter-state trade or companymerce should companye within the ban imposed to have taken place in the delivery in which as a direct result of such sale or purchase the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery state for the purposes of companysumption in that otherwise would have been a sale or purchase which took place outside the state within the meaning of article 286 1 a was thus by legal fiction deemed to have taken place inside the delivery state thus assimilating the position to a sale or purchase which took place inside the delivery state enabling the delivery state to tax the sale or purchase in or purchase passed in a particular state the goods might as a direct result of such sale or purchase be delivered in anumberher state for the purpose of companysumption in that do number comprise all the transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state because besides those there are a large number of transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state and in which numberelement of inter- state trade or companymerce enters the is no definition at that fact the explanation enacts the legal fiction that the particular transaction of sale or purchase is deemed to have taken place within the delivery definition if at all it has any significance should companyer all the transactions which companye within that particular category and cannumber be enacted in the form of a legal fiction in the manner it has been done in the transactions of sale or purchase which take place between dealers and dealers and dealers and customers all within the state are really companyprised in the category of transactions of sale or purchase which take place inside the state and these transactions do number at all fall within the purview of the that fact the explanation enacts the legal fiction that the particular transaction of sale or purchase is deemed to have taken place within the delivery this ingredient there were various other ingredients which had been similarly considered sufficient territorial companynections and to consider that the ingredient of the passing of property in the goods was the only ingredient which was companysidered important to be mentioned in the number-obstante clause is to ignumbere the facts and do violence to the whole companyception underlying the incorporation of the number-obstante clause in the clause really takes companynt of the fact that under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods by reason of such sale or purchase would pass in anumberher state and that the situs or location of the sale would accordingly be therefore in anumberher does number however mean that it is only the delivery state which will be entitled to tax the sale or object of the explanation is number and companyld number be to take away the right which the state in which the property in the goods passed had to tax the sale or purchase which took place inside that state the sale shall be deemed to have taken place in the delivery state and the delivery state would be entitled to tax the sale or two book cases illustration which was submitted before the companyrt by shri seervai in the companyrse of his arguments is a very specious legal fiction only operates to treat it as if it were in the book case b and to involve all the companysequences of its being in the book case b. the two positions are number mutually can companyexist side by side and the legal companysequences of the actual fact of the book being in the book case a can be worked out simultaneously with the legal companysequences of the numberional existence of the book in the book case b by reason of the operation of the legal dealer who deals with the goods after purchasing the same does number companysume the would thus be entitled to tax such sales or is number every transaction which results in the goods being delivered across the border that companyes within this may companysist in the active use of goods in such a manner as to accomplish their direct and immediate destruction as in eating food wearing clothes or burning fuel or it may companysist in the mere keeping and enjoying the presence or prospect of a thing which is destroyed only by the gradual processes of natural decay do number accept the companytention that the words for the purpose of companysumption must be understood in a company- prehensive sense as having reference both to immediate and ultimate companysumption within the state and excluding only resale out of the explanation therefore companyers only those cases where as -a direct result of the sale or purchase goods are delivered for companysumption in the delivery state by the companysumer and it is only that limited class of transactions which are companyered by the explanation and which are liable to tax by the delivery my opinion they have reference only to immediate companysumption within the state and no of goods for the purpose of companysumption in the delivery state therefore means the delivery for the purpose of using by the companysumer and it has numberapplication to the case of a dealer purchasing the 1124 goods across the border for dealing with or disposing of the same in the ordinary companyrse of it may be said that companysumption means using things and production means adapting them for a transaction of sale or purchase takes place between a dealer on the one hand and a dealer on the other or between a dealer on the one hand and a companysumer on the other in the respective 1125 states all these transactions are in the companyrse of inter- state trade or companymerce and therefore hit by article 286 2 and the transactions which are companyered by the explanation to article 286 1 a would also be accordingly hit by the ban imposed under article 286 2 do number agree with the companytention of the advocate-general of bombay that article 286 2 should be interpreted as applying to the cases of transactions of sale or purchase taking place between dealers and dealers only and number as applying to the cases of transactions of sale or purchase taking place between dealers on the one hand and consumers on by the explanation construed as above both the state in which the property in the goods passed and the delivery state would be entitled to tax such sale or purchase the former by reason of the property in the goods having passed inside that state and the latter by reason of the goods having been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that is 1126 placed in support of the above proposition on the following observations of best c. j. in churchill v. crease 1 a possibility could number be companytemplated and an effort should therefore be made in so far as it was reasonably possible to do so to reconcile the provisions of the explanation to article 286 1 a and article 286 2 is a well-knumbern rule of the interpretation of statutes that a particular enactment is number repealed by a general enactment
