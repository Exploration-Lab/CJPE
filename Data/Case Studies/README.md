# Case Studies

We did not divide the cases in the corpus into train, development and test set based on any temporal consideration or stratification, because the objective of the system that may eventually emerge from the project is not meant to be limited to any particular law or laws, nor focused on any particular period of time. On the contrary, the aim is to identify common features of judgments pronounced in relation to various legislation, by different judges, and across different temporal phases, so as to be able to use the said features to decipher the judicial decision-making process and successfully predict the nature of the order finally pronounced by the court given a set of facts and legal arguments. While there would be a degree of subjectivity involved given the difference in the thoughts and interpretations adopted by different judges, such differences are to be also found between two judges who are contemporaries of each other, as much as between two judges who have pronounced judgments on similar matters across a gap of decades. The focus is therefore to develop a system that would be equally successful in predicting the outcome of a judgment given the law that had been in vogue twenty years back, as it would in relation to law that is currently in practice. The validity and efficacy of the system can therefore be equally tested by applying it to cases from years back, as to cases from more recent period. In fact, if the system cannot be temporally independent, and remains limited to only successful prediction of contemporary judgments, then it is likely to fail any test of application, because by the time the final version of the system can be ready for practical application on a large scale, the laws might get amended or replaced, and therefore, the judgments that would subsequently be rendered by the court might be as different from one pronounced today, as the latter might differ from one pronounced in the twentieth century. Not acknowledging time as a factor during data sample choice, therefore, appears to be the prudent step in this case, especially given the exponential rate at which legislation is getting amended today, as well as the fast-paced growth of technological development.

## Corpus Creation

Each document was annotated by 5 experts (in isolation) using the WebAnno framework. The annotators could assign ranks to the sentences selected as explanations; a higher rank indicates more importance than the final judgment. The rationale for rank assignment to the sentences is as follows. Rank 1 was given to sentences immediately leading to the decision. Rank 2 was assigned to sentences that contributed to the decision. Rank 3 was given to sentences indicative of the disagreement of the current court with a lower court/tribunal decision. Sentences containing the facts of the case, not immediately, leading to decision making, but are essential for the case were assigned Rank 4 (or lower). Note in practice, only a small set of sentences of a document were assigned a rank.

## Explainability Annotations

* __*Annotation Assignment 1954_13:*__ In this case, although the original decision is that the appeal has been rejected, Users 1-4 have reached the decision that it has been accepted, while User 5 has decided that it has been rejected. This discrepancy appears to owe it origin to the very nature of the case and the issues considered by the court. There had been more than one such issue and separate arguments had been made by appellant in favour of each of such issue and associated prayer. The court appears to have agreed to some of the arguments and disagreed with the rest. Given the binary nature of the choice available to the Users, they could therefore decided the matter either way, as seems to have been done. The exact decision might therefore have been better described as partially accepted/partially rejected –however, this alternative option had not been made available. This indicates that for cases involving multiple issues, providing such a third option might yield more accurate results and uniformity of user-decision.

* __*Annotation Assignment 1961\_417:*__ In this case, although the original decision is that the appeal has been rejected, Users 2 and 4 have decided that it has been accepted. User 2 appears to have misconstrued certain positions of law and relied unduly upon one of the other cases being cited as precedent (but not considered relevant by the Supreme Court), which might account for the divergence. In case of User 4, however, the issue appears to be more of a linguistic matter. User 4 has referred to a particular statement made by the court, “The main question that arises in this appeal is whether an illegitimate son of a sudra vis-a-vis his self acquired property, after having succeeded to a half share of his putative fathers estate, will be entitled to succeed to the other half share got by the widow, after the succession opened out to his putative father on the death of the said widow.” From this sentence, User 4 has drawn the inference that the appellant was the one asking to establish such entitlement. Since the court in subsequent comments agreed that such entitlement does exist, User 4 inferred that the appeal had been accepted. However, in reality, the appellant had been contesting such entitlement. The court’s singular way of drafting the issue under contention, together with User 4 not having studied more thoroughly the facts leading to the case in the first place (which might have helped the user to reach a conclusion about the appellant’s prayers more accurately) appear to have contributed to this discrepancy.
   
* __*Annotation Assignment 1962\_47:*__ In this case, although the original decision is that the appeal has been rejected, Users 2 and 5 have decided that it has been accepted. This discrepancy appears to owe its origin to both of them having been misled by Sentence 17 of the case, which appears to refer to the Supreme Court having accepted an appeal and merely giving reasons for such order in the present case. However, the case in point was actually arising from an application for review of the court’s earlier judgment (acceptance of the appeal), and therefore, when the court was affirming its earlier judgment and giving reasons behind it, it was in reality rejecting this present application for review, that had been made by the party (respondent in the original appeal) aggrieved by the acceptance of such appeal by the court earlier. Users 2 and 5 could not apparently distinguish the appeal from the review petition and that appears to have led to such discrepancy.


## An example case description

Das Gupta, J. This appeal by special leave is against the order of the High Court at Allahabad under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The three appellants carry on the trade of auctioning vegetables. These vegetables, it appears, are brought in carts which are parked on the public road outside the building where the auctioning takes place. There was some dispute between these appellants and the Municipal Board which it is suggested by the appellants was really behind the move to get this order under s. 133 passed against them. It is unnecessary, however, for us to consider that matter. What appears to be clear is that the trade is carried on in a private house in the subzimandi quarter and it does happen that some amount of inconvenience is caused to people who pass by the public road because of the carts which necessarily come near this house. The real question is, whether because this trade of auctioning vegetables which the appellants carry on in their private house produce the consequence that people passing by the road are put to inconvenience, action can be taken under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
    The High Court seems to be of the opinion - when it is clear that the business of auctioning vegetables cannot be carried on without causing obstruction to the passers by, the conduct of the business can be prohibited, even though it is carried on in a private place. It seems to us that this proposition has been put too widely. Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers action by the District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Magistrate 1st class to remove public nuisances in certain circumstances. Two out of the several cls. of s. 133(1) in which these circumstances are set out, with which we are concerned, are the first and second clauses. The first clause provides for action by Magistrate where he considers, on receiving a police-report or other information and on taking such evidence as he thinks fit, that any unlawful obstruction or nuisance should be removed from any way, river or channel which is or may be lawfully used by the public or from any public place. The second clause deals with the position where the conduct of any trade or occupation or the keeping of any goods or merchandise, is injurious to the health or physical comfort of the community and that in consequence such trade or occupation should be prohibited or regulated or such goods or merchandise should be removed or the keeping thereof regulated. It is difficult to see how the first clause can have any application.
    Unlawful obstruction, if any, is certainly not caused by the people who carry on the trade of auctioning. If the obstruction caused by keeping the carts on the road can be considered to be unlawful obstruction within the meaning of this clause - about which we express no opinion action can be taken against the persons causing such obstruction. The obvious difficulty in the way of that might be that the persons who bring the carts are not the same from day do day. But whether or not any action is possible under s. 133 against the persons bringing the carts, we are unable to agree that merely because the appellants carry on auctioning in connection with which the carts are brought, they can be considered to have caused the obstruction. In our opinion, the appellants cannot be considered to be the persons causing obstruction. Turning now to the next clause, the question arises how the conduct of this auctioning trade is injurious to the health or physical comfort of the community. Undoubtedly, some amount of noise the auction is going on. That however is a necessary concomitant of buying and selling large quantities and it will be unreasonable to think that merely because some amount of noise is caused which people preferring perfect peace may not like, this is injurious to the physical comfort, or health of the community. It appears to us that the conduct of trades of this nature and indeed of other trades in localities of a city where such trades are usually carried on, is bound to produce some discomfort, though at the same time resulting perhaps in the good of the community in other respects. If a trade like auctioning which has to be carried on as necessary for the well being of the community, some amount of noise has to be borne in at least that part of the town where such trade is ordinarily carried on. 
    In making the provisions of s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the legislature cannot have intended the stoppage of such trades in such part of the town, merely because of the discomfort caused by the noise in carrying on the trade. In our opinion therefore, the slight discomfort that may be caused to some people passing by the road or living in the neighbourhood cannot ordinarily be considered to be such as to justify action under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We do not think that the orders are justified under s. 133.
