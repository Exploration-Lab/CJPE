# Case Studies

We did not divide the cases in the corpus into train, development and test set based on any temporal consideration or stratification, because the objective of the system that may eventually emerge from the project is not meant to be limited to any particular law or laws, nor focused on any particular period of time. On the contrary, the aim is to identify common features of judgments pronounced in relation to various legislation, by different judges, and across different temporal phases, so as to be able to use the said features to decipher the judicial decision-making process and successfully predict the nature of the order finally pronounced by the court given a set of facts and legal arguments. While there would be a degree of subjectivity involved given the difference in the thoughts and interpretations adopted by different judges, such differences are to be also found between two judges who are contemporaries of each other, as much as between two judges who have pronounced judgments on similar matters across a gap of decades. The focus is therefore to develop a system that would be equally successful in predicting the outcome of a judgment given the law that had been in vogue twenty years back, as it would in relation to law that is currently in practice. The validity and efficacy of the system can therefore be equally tested by applying it to cases from years back, as to cases from more recent period. In fact, if the system cannot be temporally independent, and remains limited to only successful prediction of contemporary judgments, then it is likely to fail any test of application, because by the time the final version of the system can be ready for practical application on a large scale, the laws might get amended or replaced, and therefore, the judgments that would subsequently be rendered by the court might be as different from one pronounced today, as the latter might differ from one pronounced in the twentieth century. Not acknowledging time as a factor during data sample choice, therefore, appears to be the prudent step in this case, especially given the exponential rate at which legislation is getting amended today, as well as the fast-paced growth of technological development.

## Corpus Creation

Each document was annotated by 5 experts (in isolation) using the WebAnno framework. The annotators could assign ranks to the sentences selected as explanations; a higher rank indicates more importance than the final judgment. The rationale for rank assignment to the sentences is as follows. Rank 1 was given to sentences immediately leading to the decision. Rank 2 was assigned to sentences that contributed to the decision. Rank 3 was given to sentences indicative of the disagreement of the current court with a lower court/tribunal decision. Sentences containing the facts of the case, not immediately, leading to decision making, but are essential for the case were assigned Rank 4 (or lower). Note in practice, only a small set of sentences of a document were assigned a rank.
