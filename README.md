# CJPE (Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation)
Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation

The repository contains the full codebase of experiments and results in the paper "Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation (CJPE) on Indian Supreme Court Cases". You can get ILDC dataset in the Dataset folder.

Our contributions can be summarized as below:
* We introduce a new task â€“ Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation (CJPE) with the following sub-tasks: Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation of the Prediction.
* We create a new corpus (Indian Legal Documents Corpus (ILDC) annotated with court decisions and corresponding explanations.
* We develop a battery of methods to solve the task. We perform an extensive experimentation with state of the art machine learning algorithms for the judgement prediction task. We develop a new method for explaining machine predictions since none of the existing methods could be readily applied in our setting. We evaluate our explainability results with annotations by legal experts, showing significant differences between point of view of algorithms and experts. We also perform a detailed case study to understand the annotations by lawyers (for more details please check the paper)
